Given an array A of N distinct and positive elements, the task is to find number of unordered pairs whose sum already exists in given array.

Expected Complexity : n^2

CONSTRAINTS

1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= A[i] <= 10^6 + 5
SAMPLE INPUT

A : [ 3, 4, 2, 6 ,7]
SAMPLE OUTPUT

2
EXPLANATION

The pairs following the conditions are : 
(2,4) = 6,
