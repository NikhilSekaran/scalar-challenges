Problem Description

You are given a matrix A, you have to return another matrix which is the transpose of A.

NOTE: Transpose of a matrix A is defined as - AT[i][j] = A[j][i] ; Where 1 ≤ i ≤ col and 1 ≤ j ≤ row



Problem Constraints

1 <= A.size() <= 1000

1 <= A[i].size() <= 1000

1 <= A[i][j] <= 1000



Input Format

First argument is vector of vector of integers A representing matrix.



Output Format

You have to return a vector of vector of integers after doing required operations.



Example Input

Input 1:

A = [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, 9]]
Input 2:

A = [[1, 2],[1, 2],[1, 2]]


Example Output

Output 1:

[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]
Output 2:

[[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2]]


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

Cearly after converting rows to column and columns to rows of [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, 9]] we will get [[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]].
